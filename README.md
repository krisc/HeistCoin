# HeistCoin

>HeistCoin is an exotic asset with such high volatility that greedy scammers, fraudsters, and thieves (such as yourself) rob banks of these assets, sell them off at exchanges, escape the cops by leaving town, then doing it all over again in the next town. These robbers won't stop until they get caught by the cops. Even with such high prices shooting to da moon, what good are your hodlings when you'll just end up rekt and in jail?

This game was developed for the repl.it Game Jam challenge. The leaderboard feature was developed for the Ethereal Hackathon.

- Make sure you login to MetaMask and connect to the POA network before loading the game. Highscores are recorded on a smart contract deployed on the POA Core blockchain located at this address: 0x3d446e47b4b3f09f9dd2c850b347a5405fa1052a

Here are some tips:

- The price won't fluctuate until you rob a bank in the current town.
- If you try to camp and let the price moon, more cops will go after you. Every time the price dips, a new cop car will spawn. When the alarm on top of the cops building is on and you touch the building, you will get caught and it's game over :(
- You can just leave a town whenever you want. If you see that an exchange or banks are unreachable, just leave town and go to the next.


Known issues:
- The leaderboard screen is somewhat finnicky. Sometimes player names are listed as 'undefined'. This may depend on confirmation times of transactions being variable and also the retrieval time of data from the blockchain being variable. You can refresh the page and go to the leaderboard again if you didn't see your score the first time.
