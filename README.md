# HeistCoin

>>HeistCoin is an exotic asset with such high volatility that greedy scammers, fraudsters, and thieves (such as yourself) rob banks of these assets, sell them off at exchanges, escape the cops by leaving town, then doing it all over again in the next town. These robbers won't stop until they get caught by the cops. Even with such high prices shooting to da moon, what good are your hodlings when you'll just end up rekt and in jail?
